## DataGenerator Class Documentation

### Overview:
The `DataGenerator` class serves as a pivotal component in the test generation framework. Its primary function is to produce test data based on a provided library of test cases and specific configurations. By doing so, it ensures that the generated tests adhere to the given criteria, such as possible fields, modes, and types of cases.

### Initialization:
The `DataGenerator` class can be initialized in various ways, depending on the requirements and the level of specificity needed.

#### Basic Initialization:
The simplest way to initialize the `DataGenerator` class is by providing just the test library:

```python
generator = DataGenerator(library=your_test_library)
```

#### Full Initialization:
For a more detailed configuration, you can provide additional parameters:

```python
generator = DataGenerator(
    library=your_test_library,
    banned_fields=["field1", "field2"],
    possible_fields=["field3", "field4"],
    possible_modes={"mode1": "value1", "mode2": "value2"},
    type_of_cases=["type1", "type2"],
    types_for_generation=["type3", "type4"],
    amount=10
)
```

#### Simplified Initialization:
In cases where you only want to specify the types of cases and types for generation as strings:

```python
generator = DataGenerator(
    library=your_test_library,
    type_of_cases="type1",
    types_for_generation="type3"
)
```

### Usage Examples:

#### Running the DataGenerator:
To execute the test generation process, use the `run` method:

```python
generator.run()
```

#### Retrieving a Single Test Case:
If you wish to obtain a specific test case, you can use the appropriate method:

```python
# This method needs to be verified in the code for its exact name and usage
single_test_case = generator.get_single_test_case(case_name="desired_case_name")
```

#### Accessing Generated Combinations:
Post generation, you can access the combinations created:

```python
combinations = generator.combinations
for combination_name, combination_instance in combinations.items():
    # Process each combination as needed
```

### Result Conclusion:
Upon completion of the test generation process, the results can be accessed and processed as required. The `combinations` attribute of the `DataGenerator` class holds the generated test data, with each combination being an instance of the `Combination` class. This allows for further manipulation, analysis, or export of the test data as needed.

Note: Always refer to the actual code implementation for any updates or changes to the methods and their usages.
