# Release Notes: Version 0.2.9

## Bug Fixes:
1. **Logging bug:** Small logging bug fixed

# Release Notes: Version 0.2.8

## Enhancements:
1. **Enhanced Exception Clarity:** Error messages are now more understandable, and appropriate exceptions are raised. This improvement helps you identify launch issues and alerts you to any non-unique names.
2. **Logging in Standard Steps:** All standard steps now feature logging, providing better insight and traceability during testing.

## Bug Fixes:
1. **Randomized Case Selection:** Combidata now randomly combines cases, enhancing the diversity and effectiveness of testing scenarios.

# Release Notes: Version 0.2.7

## Optimization:
1. **Case Amount Optimization:** Now it will be faster.

# Release Notes: Version 0.2.6

## Bug Fixes:
1. **Main Cases Bugs Fixed:** Small fix for impossible main cases, now they ignored.




# Release Notes: Version 0.2.5

## Bug Fixes:
1. **Multidimensional Graph Bugs Fixed:** I've ironed out the bugs in the multidimensional graph, ensuring smoother and more reliable performance.

# Release Notes: Version 0.2.4

## Enhancements:
1. **Multidimensional Graph Overhaul:** The multidimensional graph has been reworked for improved performance and efficiency.
2. **Initial Generation Function Rework:** The function for initial data generation has been redesigned. Now, combinations are calculated dynamically during runtime, rather than pre-computed before launch. This change enhances the flexibility and responsiveness of the system.
3. **New Class Methods - Run1 and Extend Cases:** For scenarios where pre-calculation of combinations is required, new class methods 'Run1' and 'Extend Cases' have been introduced. These methods provide additional control and customization options for data generation and processing.

## Bug Fixes:
1. **Multidimensional Combinatorial Graph Bugs Addressed:** Several bugs in the multidimensional combinatorial graph have been identified and fixed, ensuring more stable and reliable operations.

## Functionality Improvements:
1. **Enhanced Functions:** Various functions have been refined for better performance and user experience, contributing to the overall robustness of the application.
