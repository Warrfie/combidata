### What is Compositional Testing?

Compositional testing is a testing approach that focuses on testing individual components of a system in isolation and then testing them in combination. This method ensures that each component functions as expected on its own and in conjunction with other components. Combidata leverages this approach to provide a comprehensive testing solution for IT products, ensuring that all possible combinations of functionalities are tested and validated.
